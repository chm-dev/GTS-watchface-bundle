This is forked watchfaceEditor with experimnental and really quick addition of Amazfit GTS.

Also added quick electron build for convenience.

You can grab built version from [release](https://github.com/chm-dev/watchfaceEditor/releases/tag/GTS-electron)

If you want to build  electron app yourself, just clone this repo and 

```sh
npm run build-electron
```


I really speedran this thing so expect bugs and errors. 


Ps. Edit tools in single package are on the way.
